I'm just testing out the new Github for Mac

This is a real project, it was a LinkedIn Hackday project from July 2008 to help test out the new OpenSocial platform on linkedin.com before the final launch in the Fall.

This project uses an old version of MooFlow to provide an Apple-like Coverflow experience for browsing your LinkedIn connections.

Original name was "ConnectionFlow"
